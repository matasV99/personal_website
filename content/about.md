I am a first year PhD student at McGill University, advised by Dr. [Gustavo Turecki](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychiatry/gustavo-turecki). 

I am interested in studying how genetics and epigenetics lead to long-lasting (mal)adaptive changes in our brain cells that influence human behavior in health and disease. To that end, I have developed an interest in next-generation gene sequencing technologies that can profile brain cells at a single-cell and spatial resolution. I am currently working on projects studying molecular adaptations in the postmortem brains of people with a history of childhood abuse as well as depressed suiciders.

Before my PhD, I spent 3 years working in Dr. [Jinyue Liu](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis/our-people/faculty-staff/members/jinyue-liu)'s lab at the Genome Institute of Singapore where I studied Parkinson's disease in midbrain-like organoids using single spatial transcriptomics. My undergraduate degree is from Yale-NUS college in Singapore where I majored in Life Sciences and minored in Physical sciences. 

I grew up in Lithuania, Kaunas.
